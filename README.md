# Alx Prodev Backend Programme

## Brief Overview

The Airbnb Clone Project is a comprehensive, real-world application designed to simulate the development of a robust booking platform like Airbnb. It involves a deep dive into full-stack development, focusing on backend systems, database design, API development, and application security. This project enables learners to understand complex architectures, workflows, and collaborative team dynamics while building a scalable web application.

## Project Goals

* User Management: Implement a secure system for user registration, authentication, and profile management.
* Property Management: Develop features for property listing creation, updates, and retrieval.
* Booking System: Create a booking mechanism for users to reserve properties and manage booking details.
* Payment Processing: Integrate a payment system to handle transactions and record payment details.
* Review System: Allow users to leave reviews and ratings for properties.
* Data Optimisation: Ensure efficient data retrieval and storage through database optimisations.

## Technology Stack

* Django: A high-level Python web framework used for building the RESTful API.
* Django REST Framework: Provides tools for creating and managing RESTful APIs.
* PostgreSQL: A powerful relational database used for data storage.
* GraphQL: Allows for flexible and efficient querying of data.
* Celery: For handling asynchronous tasks such as sending notifications or processing payments.
* Redis: Used for caching and session management.
* Docker: Containerization tool for consistent development and deployment environments.
* CI/CD Pipelines: Automated pipelines for testing and deploying code changes.

## Team Roles
* Backend Developer: Responsible for implementing API endpoints, database schemas, and business logic.
* Database Administrator: Manages database design, indexing, and optimisations.
* DevOps Engineer: Handles deployment, monitoring, and scaling of the backend services.
* QA Engineer: Ensures the backend functionalities are thoroughly tested and meet quality standards.

## Database Design

### Users

* GET /users/ - List all users
* POST /users/ - Create a new user
* GET /users/{user_id}/ - Retrieve a specific user

### Properties

* GET /properties/ - List all properties
* POST /properties/ - Create a new property
* GET /properties/{property_id}/ - Retrieve a specific property
* PUT /properties/{property_id}/ - Update a specific property
* DELETE /properties/{property_id}/ - Delete a specific property

### Bookings

* GET /bookings/ - List all bookings
* POST /bookings/ - Create a new booking
* GET /bookings/{booking_id}/ - Retrieve a specific booking
* PUT /bookings/{booking_id}/ - Update a specific booking
* DELETE /bookings/{booking_id}/ - Delete a specific booking

### Payments

* POST /payments/ - Process a payment

### Reviews

* GET /reviews/ - List all reviews
* POST /reviews/ - Create a new review
* GET /reviews/{review_id}/ - Retrieve a specific review
* PUT /reviews/{review_id}/ - Update a specific review
* DELETE /reviews/{review_id}/ - Delete a specific review

## Feature Breakdown

### API Documentation
OpenAPI Standard: The backend APIs are documented using the OpenAPI standard to ensure clarity and ease of integration.
Django REST Framework: Provides a comprehensive RESTful API for handling CRUD operations on user and property data.
GraphQL: Offers a flexible and efficient query mechanism for interacting with the backend.

### User Authentication
Endpoints: /users/, /users/{user_id}/
Features: Register new users, authenticate, and manage user profiles.

### Property Management
Endpoints: /properties/, /properties/{property_id}/
Features: Create, update, retrieve, and delete property listings.

### Booking System
Endpoints: /bookings/, /bookings/{booking_id}/
Features: Make, update, and manage bookings, including check-in and check-out details.

### Payment Processing
Endpoints: /payments/
Features: Handle payment transactions related to bookings.

### Review System
Endpoints: /reviews/, /reviews/{review_id}/
Features: Post and manage reviews for properties.

### Database Optimisations
Indexing: Implement indexes for fast retrieval of frequently accessed data.
Caching: Use caching strategies to reduce database load and improve performance.

## API Security

### Authentication

Implementation:
* Use secure authentication methods such as JWT(JSON Web Tokens) or OAuth 2.0.
* Passwords are hashed and salted before storage using algorithms like bcrypt.
* Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) for added protection on critical accounts (e.g., hosts and admins).

Why it’s crucial:
Authentication ensures that only legitimate users can access their accounts. It protects user identities, personal details, and account integrity from unauthorised access or impersonation.

### Authorisation

Implementation:
* Apply Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to separate permissions between guests, hosts, and admins.
* Use middleware to check user roles before accessing routes (e.g., only hosts can list properties, only admins can remove listings).

Why it’s crucial:
Authorisation prevents privilege escalation and ensures that users can only perform actions allowed for their roles, keeping sensitive operations and data safe.

### Input Validation & Sanitization

Implementation:
* Validate all user inputs on both the client and server sides.
* Use libraries to sanitise inputs and prevent SQL Injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.

Why it’s crucial:
Protects the system from malicious input that could compromise the database, user data, or application integrity.

### Rate Limiting & Brute-Force Protection

Implementation:
* Apply rate limiting on login, signup, and API endpoints using libraries like express-rate-limit (in Node.js).
* Implement account lockouts or CAPTCHA after multiple failed login attempts.

Why it’s crucial:
Prevents brute-force attacks and API abuse, ensuring platform stability and protecting users’ accounts from being compromised.

## CI/CD Pipeline

### What is CI/CD

CI/CD stands for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (or Delivery). It is an automated process that helps developers build, test, and deploy code changes quickly and reliably.

* Continuous Integration (CI): Automatically runs tests and builds the application whenever new code is pushed to the repository, ensuring that the codebase remains stable and free of errors.

* Continuous Deployment (CD): Automatically deploys the latest verified version of the app to a server or cloud environment (e.g., staging or production).

### Why CI/CD Is Important for the Project

* Implementing CI/CD pipelines in the Airbnb clone project ensures:

* Faster Development: Automates repetitive tasks, allowing developers to focus on features instead of manual deployment.

* Higher Code Quality: Automated testing detects bugs early, reducing the risk of breaking the app.

* Reliable Deployments: Consistent build and deployment processes prevent configuration errors.

* Collaboration Efficiency: Multiple contributors can integrate changes smoothly without conflicts or downtime.

### Tools That Could Be Used

* GitHub Actions – For automating testing, building, and deployment directly from the GitHub repository.

* Docker – For containerising the application to ensure consistent behaviour across development, testing, and production environments.

* Jenkins or GitLab CI/CD – Alternative tools for advanced pipeline automation.

* AWS / Render / Netlify / Vercel – For hosting and deploying the backend or frontend applications.
